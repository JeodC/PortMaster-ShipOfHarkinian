## Information
Ship of Harkinian binaries were built from the develop branch (bleeding edge) on 07/18/2024. You can build your own by following the [BUILDING.md guide](BUILDING.md).

## Installation
You need to provide your own roms. See the [Shipwright](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/blob/8.0.5/docs/supportedHashes.json) repository for a list of supported rom hashes. Gather your roms and put them in the `ports/soh` folder. Start the port, and on first run, your .otr files will be generated from the roms you provide. Note that only one `oot.otr` and `oot-mq.otr` will be made--if you provide more than one rom per game, strange things may occur. You *can* use pregenerated `.otr` files from elsewhere, but you may experience crashes.

Texture pack files and mods can be added to the `ports/soh/mods` folder. 

If you want to import a save, run the port once, and it will create a `save` folder. Then add your savegame to `soh/save` or `soh/Save`.

Logs are recorded automatically as `ports/soh/log.txt`. Please provide a log if you report an issue. PortMaster does not maintain the Ship of Harkinian repository and is not responsible for bugs or issues outside of our control. Likewise, HarbourMasters is not affiliated with PortMaster and this distribution is not officially supported by them. *Please come to PortMaster for help before approaching the HarbourMasters!*

## Menu Navigation
There is a `soh.gptk` file you can use to change which button emulates F1 (default is L3). Once you do so, make the menu bar appear, hold the north or west button (X or Y -- one of them will cause a white hue to appear), press R1 while keeping that other button held, then release both buttons and press X or Y again to access the menu bar navigation.

The GUI may be too large or small. Navigate to Settings->Graphics->IMGUI Menu Scale to change it.

## Default Gameplay Controls
The port uses SDL controller mapping and controls can be remapped from the menu bar.

## Suggested Mods
You can find a ton of mods at [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/games/16121?_aFilters%5BGeneric_Name%5D=contains%2C3ds&_sSort=Generic_MostDownloaded).  

I prefer the OoT 3DS look along with a studio ghibli style skybox:
